# Supply-Chain-Management
## Overview
In response to challenges faced by a Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company in managing their instant noodles business, this project aims to build a model using historical data to determine the optimum weight of the product to be shipped from each warehouse. Over the past two years, the company's higher management has observed a significant mismatch between demand and supply, leading to inventory cost losses and overall financial impacts. The project focuses on optimizing the supply quantity in each warehouse across the entire country.
